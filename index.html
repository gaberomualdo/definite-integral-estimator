        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter your integral and generate the graph. Then download the graph onto your computer. Take a look at the photo if you want. It should be
            a photo of a graph of the integral.
          </li>
          <li>Upload the downloaded graph into the estimator section and get your result.</li>
          <!-- <li>
            Other stuff: Make sure your equation is legit. Use ^ for exponents, and add a buncha parentheses just in case the parser encounters
            problems. Generally this method isn't efficient at all since it generates images with a 1:1 aspect ratio. So no scaling the y axis. The
            better option here would be to scale the y axis and use steganography to encode the aspect ratio in the last couple bytes of the pixels of
            the image.
          </li> -->
          <li>
            Use any variable name you want but make sure to only have one variable used; this is case sensitive. Use an astericks in place of general
            multiplication in some cases to be safe. Constants such as PI and E are not supported at this time. Do not change the given name of the
            file before you upload. Things can get screwed up when a and b are not integers. Make sure a is less than b. Some equations work better
            than others (in some cases certain equations don't work at all).
          </li>
          <li>If you are legitimately using this calculator to solve definite integrals: why? Are you okay. I am concerned.</li>

          <p>It worked! Here's the estimate:</p>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>
            Obviously this is just an estimate. It's quite literally the same thing as Riemann sums. Except it makes a file. So it just wastes storage
            space and energy. But isn't that like 90%+ of the content on the WWW? Something to think about.
